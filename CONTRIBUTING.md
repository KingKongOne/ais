## Development guidelines

- AIS needs to work on desktops, laptops, tablets, phones etc. so **responsive design is a must**.
- We use the **Bootstrap** framework for front-end design.
- **Business logic should be done server side** with Django. **You can use JavaScript for UX** purposes (e.g. form checking) but the app should still work correctly with JavaScript turned off.
- **Don't add extra dependencies** unless there's a compelling reason to do so.
- **Do add extra dependencies** if there's a compelling reason to do so. Example: Date widgets.
